   - Proper use of database indexes and constraints
   - Connection pooling and resource management
   - Database migration scripts quality
   - ORM usage patterns (SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, etc.)
   - Transaction management and ACID compliance

4. **Python-Specific Performance & Efficiency**
   - List comprehensions vs loops optimization
   - Generator usage for memory efficiency  
   - Proper use of Python data structures (dict, set, tuple)
   - Database connection management and connection pooling
   - Async/await patterns for database operations (if applicable)

5. **Python Best Practices & Code Quality**
   - PEP 8 style guide adherence
   - Proper exception handling with specific exception types
   - Context managers for database connections and file operations
   - Type hints usage (Python 3.5+)
   - Docstrings following PEP 257
   - Environment variable and configuration management
   - SQL injection prevention and parameterized queries
   - Database credentials security (no hardcoded passwords)

6. **Testing & Coverage (Python + Database)**
   - Unit tests using pytest/unittest
   - Database test fixtures and test data management
   - Mock usage for database operations in unit tests
   - Integration tests for database operations
   - Test database setup/teardown procedures
   - Coverage analysis with coverage.py

def get_user(id):
    conn = psycopg2.connect("host=localhost...")
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s" % id)  # SQL injection risk
    return cursor.fetchone()

# Example: After (improved)
def get_user(user_id: int) -> Optional[User]:
    """Retrieve user by ID with proper error handling."""
    with get_db_connection() as conn:
        with conn.cursor() as cursor:
            cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s", (user_id,))
            return cursor.fetchone()
```

## Additional Python + PostgreSQL Context

**Please specifically analyze:**

### ðŸ Python-Specific Areas:
- **PEP 8 Compliance**: Line length, imports, spacing, naming
- **Type Hints**: Function signatures, return types, Optional usage
- **Docstrings**: Module, class, and function documentation
- **Virtual Environment**: Requirements.txt/Pipfile updates
- **Python Version Compatibility**: Language features used
- **Import Organization**: Standard library, third-party, local imports

### ðŸ—„ï¸ Database-Specific Areas:
- **Connection Management**: Proper connection pooling (psycopg2-pool, SQLAlchemy)
- **Query Security**: Parameterized queries, SQL injection prevention
- **Migration Scripts**: Alembic migrations, schema changes
- **Database Schema**: Table design, relationships, constraints
- **Query Performance**: EXPLAIN ANALYZE usage, index optimization
- **Transaction Management**: Proper commit/rollback handling

### ðŸ”§ Framework-Specific (if applicable):
